Hi :D, i am a Federico, to be short, Pen, i am just a guy from Rome whose an amateur coder trying to learn everything by reverse engineering in 42 (i am dumb as a rock) (malphite reference).
I only know C programming for now but i have a bit of experience on Virtual machines, i am learning C thanks to 42 projects and someday i'll also learn C++'s basics with CPP modules and i Was planning to learn a bit of Java and Python aswell.
Currently i am not sure of what my plans are for the future, i'll see where my coding journey leads me and settle my ass whenever i feel ok with what i am doing.
