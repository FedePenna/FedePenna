Hi :D, i am a Federico, to be short, Pen, i am just a guy from Rome whose an amateur coder trying to learn everything by reverse engineering in 42 (i am dumb as a rock) (malphite reference).
I only know C programming for now but i have a bit of experience on Virtual machines, and i will be soon be learning
C++'s basics with CPP modules in 42
And i Was planning to learn a bit of Java and Python for the future too
Currently i am not sure of what my plans are in the future, i'll see where my coding journey leads me and settle my ass whenever i feel ok with what i am doing.
